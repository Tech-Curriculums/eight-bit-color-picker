xterm256-color-picker
=====================

> UI component for picking a color from xterm's 256 color palette

Aside from providing a color picker UI element, this library also supports
custom color maps.

Browser Requirements
--------------------
Because `element.classList` is used, at least IE10 is required. All modern
browsers handle this just fine. Polyfills can be used to bring in support for
older browsers.
